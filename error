In the equation with coefficients
a = 1.00000, b = -5.00000, c = 4.00000
In a program solution: r_count = TWO_ROOTS, x1 = 1.000000, x2 = 4.000000
In a user solution: r_count = ONE_ROOT, x1 = 0.500000, x2 = 4.000000

In the equation with coefficients
a = 1.00000, b = -6.00000, c = 9.00000
In a program solution: r_count = ONE_ROOT, x1 = 3.000000, x2 = 0.000000
In a user solution: r_count = NO_ROOTS, x1 = 3.000000, x2 = 0.000000
